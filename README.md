# BinarySearchTree.java
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in java. A BST is a data structure that maintains sorted order and allows efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. This implementation includes methods for inserting nodes, searching for values, deleting nodes, and performing an inorder traversal.

Features
Insert: Add new elements to the BST.
Search: Find elements in the BST.
Delete: Remove elements from the BST.
Inorder Traversal: Retrieve elements in sorted order.
